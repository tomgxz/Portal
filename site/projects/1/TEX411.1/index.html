            <h1 class=h6>Introduction - The Cabinet of Curiosities</h1>

            <p>
                The Cabinet of Curiosities, that originated in the Renaissance Period, were the precursors to more
                modern museums, often characterised by a collection of rare, interesting, or fantastical objects and
                artefacts. They originated in the Renaissance period as a natural progression of exploration, scientific
                advances, and cultural attitudes. As new worlds were being discovered, new creatures and objects were
                being uncovered, and global trade and exchange was increasing. As stated in <em>Cabinets of Curiosities
                    and
                    The Origin of Collecting</em>, cabinets could range in size from a small, dedicated piece of
                furniture, to an
                entire room, and they were used as a way of displaying said objects, whether for showing off wealth and
                prestige, or for inspiring wonder in its viewers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first major cabinet of curiosities in the UK was “originally [created] in the time of Elizabeth or
                James I, by John Tradescant”, and contained the combined collection of John Tradescant Sr and Jr. It
                included botanical, zoological, archeological and fantastical objects (such as a dragon's egg) that were
                compiled across the 17th century. (<em>Parker 1870</em>, p. 3). When opened to the public (in the
                1630s), it
                became “the first museum in the country which the public could visit, a permanent exhibition that
                attracted the curious and scholarly alike,” marking a significant milestone in the development of public
                access to collections and the evolution of the modern museum. (<em>Leith-Ross 1984</em>, p. 13).

                    <p>
                        As time went on, more of these private collections of objects transitioned into public museums,
                        transitioning from a haphazard and eclectic arrangement of objects to a more systematic
                        categorisation and labelling of objects, perhaps reflecting the shift in attitude towards a
                        broader education and scientific mission. Museums nowadays are centres of cultural knowledge and
                        heritage, and showcase the ongoing commitment to preserving, interpreting, and sharing the
                        world's historical and scientific heritage.

                    <p>
                        Approaching this project, the first thing I did was try to find as many historical cabinets of
                        curiosities, and observe common similarities between them. For example, a recurring theme is
                        items (such as shells or coins) seemingly scattered over a surface, as can be seen in Frans
                        Fracken the Younger's baroque painting, titled Kunst- und Raritätenkammer. This painting also
                        shows another common subject, that being paintings and other artworks. Remps' Cabinet of
                        Curiosities painting also features similar paintings, along with notes and objects being
                        attached or placed in seemingly random places, making it look more like an actual cabinet in the
                        house of an explorer or scientist.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-4">
                    <img class="img-fluid"
                        alt="Francken, F. (1636) Kunst- und Raritätenkammer (Chamber of Art and Curiosities). [Oil on Panel] Kunsthistorisches Museum, Austria."
                        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Frans_Francken_%28II%29%2C_Kunst-_und_Rarit%C3%A4tenkammer_%281636%29.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The main similarities that I noted were:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Scattered objects, such as coins, shells, fossils</li>
                <li>Paintings, often lots covering walls</li>
                <li>Books, papers or notes opened to specific pages or folds</li>
                <li>Plants / fossils / taxidermied animals (often if they appear they are the main focus of the cabinet)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                After consideration of what I could include in my cabinet (that would depict my journey to Bruford), as
                well as the actual container, I realised that most of the items that I would want to include are still
                at my old house, meaning that they would be inaccessible for use in the project. Not only this, I didn’t
                have any container that I would consider appropriate or thematic to use as the cabinet. Because of this,
                I decided that I would attempt to build the cabinet using a 3D modelling engine, and render it using
                web-based systems. I went with this choice not only because I have an extensive history creating and
                using such applications, but also because it opened up more possibilities for what I could actually put
                in the cabinet.

                <div class="col-6 mt-2">

                <div class="col-6">

                    <p>
                        The next stage was, as in any well-managed project, to plan how I wanted the cabinet to look,
                        and how it would operate. As seen in the image, I started with a basic sketch of the cabinet and
                        the objects I wanted to include, along with annotations for each object and how I wanted them to
                        be presented. In the selection of items, I tried to include some of the historical similarities
                        noted above. For example, in the final piece, the rolls of LX tape are deliberately positioned
                        to emulate the look of them being haphazardly scattered. In a similar vein, the cabinet as a
                        whole is supposed to look like it came straight out of my room, with common items that I use
                        placed “carelessly.” I initially intended for the book to also be open on a certain page, but
                        did not get around to doing it.

            <p>
                The 3D models were created/compiled in Blender, a “free and open source 3D creation suite”
                (<em>blender.org</em>, 2021). I use Blender over other software (such as Cinema 4D) due to my knowledge
                of its workflow, and more importantly that it is open source. I am a large advocate for open source
                software, and as such, the source code for my cabinet of curiosities is available to peruse at

                <a href="https://github.com/tomgxz/tree/master/projects/1/TEX411W1"
                    target="">https://github.com/tomgxz/tree/master/projects/1/TEX411W1</a>.

                While building the 3D model in Blender, I used a combination of assets that I created, and
                models/textures that I downloaded from online. Assets that I do not own are all free and openly
                available for anyone to use, and are licensed under creative commons. Appropriate credit can be found in
                the 3D Model Attribution Credit section. I feel it is important to note that, despite this, most of the
                model was constructed by me from scratch.

                        After finishing the main structure for the cabinet of curiosities, I started work on the web
                        application. It was built on a framework that I had designed for previous websites (such as my
                        online portfolio or custom build software for my college), and the cabinet was handled by
                        Three.js, “an open-source, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose JavaScript library”
                        (<em>tutorialspoint.com</em>). Three was used to render the 3D object, including attributes such
                        as lighting, camera position, movement, and materials. I also implemented some text elements to
                        label aspects of the cabinet, so that other people could understand some of the objects in the
                        cabinet.

                side of my workspace, so that I can use it if needed. I also placed my lighting workbook (the notepad
                that had the original sketch) next to the laptop.
            </p>

            <h1 class=h6>Reflection</h1>

            <p>
                Due to the timeframe I gave myself for completing the 3D model for the cabinet in 1 day, some of the
                models and textures were not up to a standard that I would've liked to use. I set myself the short
                deadline as, even though I knew it would be tough, I was conscious there were other elements that I had
                to complete, such as building the framework and writing the research for it. With more time, I would
                have added more elements to the model, and worked on making it look more realistic with better texturing
                and more complex shadow rendering. The timeframe reminded me of doing shows in theatre, with incredibly
                limited time to finish key elements before its time to present the finished piece.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                On another attempt, I would've tried to spend more time working on the 3D modelling and less on the web
                design aspects. I would also have tried to incorporate more historical context and reference into the
                cabinet - for example, I was intending to add more notes and drawings from previous shows that I have
                done, but I didn't have time for it. Similarly, I originally intended to add auditory aspects to the
                project due to my background in sound design and music production, but scrapped the idea as I was
                already pushed for time and I knew that audio would be very time-consuming to implement. As with many
                things, more time would have produced more fruitful results, but nevertheless I am happy with the final
                presentation of my work.
