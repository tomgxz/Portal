            <p>
                We started the process of idea-browsing before our intro to the brief had even ended, as we immediately
                started sending out small ideas on our WhatsApp chat. These ideas ranged from the activities we could
                make our audience do, to the things we would give them as their objects, to what facts about Rose
                Bruford we could bend to fit our story better. Afterwards, so that the next day would be easier, Emma
                compiled all these small messages into a unified mind-map, so that everything could start being put
                together.

                “During this project we went to the costume cupboard in order to find some Hi-Vis jackets for the

                tours) so seeing the process of borrowing and pulling items was helpful for future reference.
                Unfortunately we were unable to find what we needed (Fig. 2&3), as they were probably being used
                elsewhere.”

            <h1 class=h6>Tuesday - Getting props from the propstore (Izzy)</h1>

            <p class="quote">
                “On Tuesday, I went into the Rose Bruford prop store to find some props that we could use to create the
                ‘Duke of Edinburgh Award’ atmosphere in our piece and really convince the audience they are going on an
                expedition. The main items I looked for were some oversized backpacks (Fig. 1), that could be stuffed to
                create the effect of the heavy bags that would be worn by students. Additionally, I was able to borrow
                some ordinant survey maps (Fig. 2), the large ones that could fold out, as these would add comedy to the
                piece when used by the members of the group planted in the audience. Finally, I looked for some
                compasses. (Fig. 3) If we had longer to do the project, I would have liked to borrow/buy the specific
                style of compasses used on Duke of Edinburgh, large ones, with lots of colour on a clear plastic. The
                only ones in the store were old-fashioned, metal, pirate style ones that didn’t fit the atmosphere of
                the project. I took these anyway and showed them to the group as an option, but the decision was made to
                go without them in the final performance.”

            <h1 class=h6>Tuesday - Scouting the Route</h1>

            <p>
                After having a look into the Rose Bruford archives, and having had a small meeting in the uni cafe to go
                over all of our ideas so far, we decided to go outside onto the campus and walk the route we would send
                our audience on. This route started in reception (Fig. 1), went past the dome stage into a huddle of
                trees (Fig. 3&4), and carried on until we stopped by the lake by Lamorbey House (Fig. 8). At each
                checkpoint, we also discussed who would be stationed where, and what their rough ‘script’ or collection
                of facts would be.

                            tragically drowned, leading to many speculatives believing that the river had been haunted.

                        <li>We would've dismissed this as silly, but the fire safety guys were very adamant on the
                            position that we shouldn't let you on the river.</li>

                        After having done our walk-throughs and rehearsals, we felt pretty confident in our route and
                        what each person would contribute to the tour in terms of lines, facts or characters. However,
                        due to being a group of creatives, we felt inclined to keep on adding details such as certain
                        props until the very end. These last minute changes and improvements were all discussed by the
                        group through our whats-app chat (Fig. 2-4), which also allowed us to ask each-other questions
                        if e.g people still needed objects brought in. Having this easy way to communicate with
                        each-other about ideas, meant that the final performance went smoothly.

                Rose Elizabeth Bruford, born 1904, is the founder of Rose Bruford College of Theatre and performance,
                which was originally known as The Rose Bruford Training College of Speech and Drama. The school was
                founded in 1950, with the first year to graduate in 1953.
            </p>

            <p>
                When she first established the school, she had only £600 to fund the entire thing, luckily <i>“she
                    rented part of Lamorbey house from Kent Education Committee for £5 annually”</i> (Benham, 2022).
            </p>

            <p>
                According to an article from The Kentish Times, the opening of Rose Bruford was described at a
                ‘Christening’ of the school. A Speech on this day was given by Dame Sybil Thorndike, Actor and college
                patron. In her speech she said <i>“In Rose Bruford College you have something that is badly neglected in
                    this country – the study of speech”</i> (Thorndike, 1951).
            </p>

            <p>
                She stepped down as the head of the school in 1970 and was succeed by Jean Norman Benedetti, a
                dramatist, actor and director.

                        The Duke of Edinburgh Award (DoE) was started by Prince Philip on the 1st of September 1956 in
                        the United Kingdom. It started as a bridge between school and service for boys, in which they
                        undertook 4 sections; rescue and public service, expeditions, pursuits and projects, and
                        fitness. The duke hoped that the programme would support, help and guide young men to gain
                        valuable skills. The pilot of the DoE was so popular, that overseas programmes for girls were
                        also introduced and the overall programme quickly grew popular.

                        The DoE is a set of challenges for young people between the ages of 14-24 that aims to create
                        and develop transferable skills such as teamwork and social interaction in young people that can
                        help them become well-rounded people who can function in professional environments.

                                we planned, mapped, prepped and walked a five day hike in Eryri National Park
                                (Snowdonia), including summiting Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon). In many ways, the group teamwork
                                and values that were used on said expedition were present in the group work for the
                                tour, with the preparation, planning and execution.Now over 130 countries and
                                territories have DoE programmes. Even during the pandemic 330000 young people still got
                                involved in the DoE volunteering in their local communities. Most recently in 2023, the
                                DoE has been passed onto the son of Prince Philip (Prince Edward, the new Duke of

            <h2 class="h6 fw-normal">It is divided into 4 sections:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Volunteering</strong> - aims to make young people look for meaningful opportunities in their
                    local environment that make a difference rather than aiming to make money. For example, working for
                    charities or non-profit organisations, social action causes, and within their school.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Physical</strong> - aims to make young people broaden their horizons, it can't be a physical
                    activity, however, they can research information about a physical activity. For example, learning
                    first aid skills, cooking, playing an instrument and learning to drive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Skills and expedition</strong> - for the expedition section a young person will have to
                    individually plan and complete an expedition with an agreed aim. They must do correct training and
                    preparation for the expedition including a practice expedition. Then they must do the self-reliant
                    expedition and then a presentation. This can include various modes of transport(not motorised) for
                    example, on foot, bicycle, kayak/canoe, or horseback.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Residential</strong> <i>(Gold level)</i> - a young person does a shared activity or course
                    away from home, possibly including both evenings and days. They must do it in a completely new
                    environment with people they don't know previously. Should last a minimum of 4 nights spent away
                    from home.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The DoE is split into 3 levels of awards- bronze, silver and gold. The bronze award is completed over a
                period of 6 months, the silver is also a 6-month timescale, and the gold lasts 12 months.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Equipment needed for the expedition section includes;</strong> clothes(walking boots,
                comfortable and waterproof clothes), a rucksack, a sleeping bag and mat, torch, first aid kit, food and
                water, cutlery, washkit, matches, a tent, stove, cooking utensils, map and compass.

            <p class="quote">
                “I participated in both the Bronze DofE (walking) (Fig. 3) as well as the Silver DofE (canoeing) (Fig.
                1-2), and had different experiences during each outing. For my Bronze, I found that I quickly learnt
                which type of people/characters I work well in a group with, and which ones I don’t. It was a great
                learning experience in terms of working together with people that are different to me and that I might
                not easily get along with. This was probably not helped by the fact we chose a walking expedition, which
                is notoriously exhausting both mentally and physically.
                <br><br>
                With my Silver DofE, the experience was greatly improved due to the fact we had canoes. I also felt that
                I chose my group much better, as we all supported each-other well and worked much better in a team.
                There was also a lot more joking and messing around (in a good way), and this is something which I would
                definitely like to include in the TEX Misguided tour. DofE can have a simultaneously serious and silly
                atmosphere, which I would like us to try and recreate.”

                                trials throughout history such as the tennis court fire in 1972 and the fire

                                The appearance of black cat is presumed to prelude a witch trial. The spectral
                                black cat
                                that prowls Bruford has been an omen of witchcraft and ritual since 1716, when
                                the
                                presumed last witch trial took place, condemning Mary Hicks. Throughout the
                                1800s
                                mysterious fires have been recorded, with furtive writings claiming that
                                witchcraft was
                                involved with Mary Hick's initials inside a rune appearing on documents. Occult
                                historians presume that these events are further attempts to burn Mary Hicks for
                                her
                                apparent crimes but it's said that she escaped again and imbued her cat with her
                                spirit.
                                she still appears today to guide those who have a talent for the magical arts.

                                The more modern day fires occurring at Bruford are the cause of some speculation

                                the Bruford community as to the cause. Non believers and cynics attribute the
                                fires to
                                causes like faulty wiring or unattended flames, but the community of Bruford
                                knows
                                better. It is said that a group lurk in the shadows of witch light, striking
                                when
                                necessary and relentless in their desire to irradiate witchcraft from the school

                                the umbra magicae. In 1972, a black cat was spotted prowling the tennis courts

                                the grounds. Consumed with fear, the umbra magicae reduced the tennis court to
                                ashes,
                                but they were not successful in destroying the cat and its magical spirit. In
                                1982 they
                                tried again, having received anonymous information that the feline was living in
                                the
                                rafters of Lamobey house, but again they were not successful. The shadows speak
                                of a
                                time where they would try again, but would they succeed in their mission? Or
                                would the
                                mystical powers in the veil elude them again?

                                that prowls Bruford has been an omen of witchcraft and ritual since 1716, when

                                mysterious fires have been recorded, with furtive writings claiming that
                                witchcraft was

            <h1 class="h6 mb-4">The Area of Sidcup & Looking at DofE-style Maps (Emma)</h1>

            <p>
                It appears that the natural geography of Sidcup and the surrounding area - still including much greenery
                and park space to this day - has always been a highlight of the area, as the place-name ‘Sidcup’ is
                thought to be derived from <i>’Cetecopp,’</i> which means meaning <i>‘seat shaped or flat topped
                    hill’</i>. The
                first recorded use of this name was 1254. These days, with the many parks and open spaces that remain,
                the area hints at the great estates and large homes which once stood there. The Independent described
                how <i>“The Sidcup site is in exquisite 18th-century parkland with squirrels, foxes, swans and a
                    lake.”</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                When looking at how Sidcup and the area around it originated, early records show that it used to be a
                small hamlet on the road from Maidstone to London. The owner of this Hamlet <i>"in the 35th year of
                    king Henry VI. [i.e. in the 1450s] as appears by his deed."</i> (Hasted, 1797) was called ‘Thomas de
                Sedcopp’. Towards the end of the 18th century, it then expanded to become "a small street of houses,
                among which is an inn of much resort" (Hasted, 1797).
            </p>

            <p>
                Sidcup has continually expanded, and in the present day includes a mix of large Victorian and Edwardian
                properties, alongside typical 1930s suburbia buildings.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of the specific Rose Bruford College campus, this was first used as an educational location
                when the Kent Education Committee offered to lease Rose Elizabeth Bruford Lamorbey House in 1950. (When
                she established the college). At the time of leasing, it was a Grade II listed manor house, going for £5
                per year. Since this, the site has grown, with the majority of new buildings being completed in 2002.

            <p>
                One of the props we wanted to include in our tour was maps, and therefore Emma found it important to
                research what actual maps (such as the ones used on Dofe) look like and include. She used the article
                ‘How to use edofe mapping’ from the ‘Aspen Outdoors’ website to get references (Fig. 4-6) for the
                colours, patterns, shapes etc. This was also helpful to find out how certain geographical elements like
                parks and rivers were drawn.

            <h1 class="h6 mb-4">The Glade by Lamorbey Park (Georgina)</h1>

            <p>
                The lake bordering Rose Bruford College and Lamorbey Park is best known as the glade. The glade is not a
                natural spring, it is derived from the river shuttle(on Avery Hill) which was dammed to create smaller
                waterways, which are located across the golf course. A plan made in 1761 was made to show the river
                shuttle being diverted into 3 smaller lakes. The glade was once used as an area for swimming when
                Lamorbey House was a hotel and many locals often swam there. The lake itself has also been used for
                fishing throughout the years, even now it is home to Lamorbey angling society.
            </p>

            <p>
                The glade has become naturalised over the last 20 years, it now supports multiple wildlife species,
                including eels and water voles. The park itself has very diverse wildlife despite its small size having
                over 105 bird species registered there. The area surrounding the lake has an established forest of
                multiple species of trees.
                Unfortunately, the lake has a medium to high flood risk during the winter times.

            <h1 class="h6 mb-4">New Re-Branded DofE Documents (Emma)</h1>

            <p>
                The first thing we thought might be a good nod to our audience was to have a DofE ‘reception’ bit at the
                start of our tour where we would take attendance of the ‘campers’. For this reception area, we wanted to
                have a DofE logo, however one that was rebranded to suit our ‘Rose Bruford Award’ idea (Fig. 2). Emma
                took on the task of creating this logo, using the app ‘Procreate’ on her Ipad. The first thing she did
                was find a normal DofE logo, which she put as a bottom layer on the drawing. Then, she used <a
                    href="https://Dafont.com">Dafont.com</a>
                to find fonts similar to the ones used in the original logo. These ended up being the ‘Yorkie’ font for
                the main ‘R,B’ letters, and the ‘Cheese Pizza’ font for the smaller caption at the bottom. By overlaying
                the new letters onto the old logo (Fig. 1), she was able to match the size and style to make it look
                like an official new logo. As an extra touch, Emma replaced the crown at the top with a rose, a nod to
                the ‘founder’ of our award.

                        To make the tour more interesting and create more audience involvement, we also thought it might
                        be fun to include completion certificates, as well as a proper register for the start (Fig. 5).
                        For the certificate, Emma once again used an original DofE document as a base, and then layered
                        text, drawings and other elements on top to change it to the new Rose Bruford theme (Fig. 4).
                        She used the article ‘Famous People Of Sidcup : Rose Bruford and Doreen Bird’ from the <i>Sidcup
                            Spotlight Autumn 2022</i> to look up Rose’s full name, as well as birth date etc.

                    <p>
                        For the register, Emma also googled what different school registers could look like, and ended
                        up going with a simple table which included the audience members’ names already (Fig. 3), looked
                        up using a TEX411 Register that included the group numbers.

            <h1 class="h6 mb-4">Maps for the Audience (Emma)</h1>

            <p>
                Due to the brief including the point of giving the audience an item/prop to identify them as the
                audience, we thought it might be fun if we had a collection of maps we could hand out at the start of
                the tour for them to follow. To make these maps, Emma first looked up an areal view of the Rose Bruford
                campus, simply using google maps (Fig. 1). Using the app Procreate on Ipad, she placed the screenshot of
                the site on the bottom layer, and then added various layers to draw over the original map. To make sure
                the style of the drawing somewhat emulated that of an actual map one might get on DofE, Emma looked up
                various DofE maps on the ‘Aspen Outdoors’ website. Through using different maps as reference, she was
                able to take inspiration from the colours, thickness of the lines, what was included and what wasn’t
                etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                After finishing the drawing (Fig. 2), she went and printed around 30 copies of the map (to make sure
                each audience member was guaranteed one). The paper Emma used was A3, as this size wasn’t too small but
                also not too big for people to carry around during the tour. Each map was then folded in the style of a
                classic navigation map (Fig. 3).

            <p>
                Thinking about how we could include multiple aspects of tech into our tour, Dom and Georgina from Audio
                Production also worked on a soundtrack to back our tour. This included animal sounds from animals common
                to the Rose Bruford site, as well as typical DofE walking songs and fire sound effects to fit in with
                the historic fires on the site.

                “Georgina and I collaborated to make a QLab file (Fig. 1) to be played throughout the event as an
                atmospheric filter, adding a wild and unhinged DofE experience with music and wildlife around us”
            </p>

            <h1 class="h6 fw-normal">Georgina's Reflections of using QLab</h1>

            <p class="quote">
                “I started the Q-lab by working out which sound effects were needed at each stage of the tour, for
                example at the bush part of the tour there were bird sound effects.
                <br><br>
                I found the sound effects on the BBC sound effects library, I started at the bush with a fire sound
                effect as that group talked about fire safety and burning things. I then added some bird noises to make
                the environment seem more natural, I wasn't expecting to see or hear much wildlife whilst we were
                touring around the campus in a large group so adding the birds made it more atmospheric being outside.
                <br><br>
                Initially starting on the lake sound effects I wanted to add a loud splash to integrate with the script,
                however, it didn't fit with the final version of the script and the overall sound effects were made to
                sound atmospheric. As we were by the lake I found a nice effect with ducks and Canadian geese on a
                lake/river, as Bruford has plenty of similar wildlife this blended into the scene nicely. Also, I found
                the sound of a canoe passing which symbolised the water activities which were spoken about during our
                tour.
                <br><br>
                I added a low pass filter on a couple of the sound effects to make them sound less sharp and more
                natural. Also, I put the sound effects in groups (where they were located in the tours) so that they
                were more organised and easier to find and follow.”

                        the audience differently, for example, the comedian introducing each act interacted with the

                <li>
                    when some members of the group weren’t able to make meetings, we sometimes had to remind ourselves
                    to keep them involved - sending a message to them to do this

                <li>
                    the costumes in the end were not what we originally planned, as the costume store did not have what

                <li>
                    the soundtrack which was fully produced didn’t end up being used as the volume didn’t end up being
                    loud enough for an outside environment

                        were played in the background during the walk. This is because we weren’t able to test the
                        volume required for the tour until the audience were in, I wasn’t able to factor in the
                        acoustics as the tracks were still being edited.

                            “My high point of the week was the performance and the humour that I was able to create in
                            my role as the ‘receptionist’. It was a great way to begin the tour and engage the audience
                            in the characters we created. I also successfully establish the start of our narrative of
                            ‘The Rose Bruford Award’ and what the audience would have to achieve through my performance.
                            One thing that I think could have been improved is trying to get more props from the store
                            to add to the different areas to transform the campus even more. As touched on earlier, I
                            did manage to get things from the store for the students, but if I had more time, I would
                            have loved to dive more into the different items I could have put in each area. For
                            instance, some ‘water based’ sports equipment down by the lake could have been a nice
                            addition. This was also limited by our budget. Going into this week I was worried about my
                            role within the team, as usually I take one of management and leadership, however, to
                            improve my collaboration, I wanted to try taking a step back this week. I was able to do
                            this successfully this week. I was part of the team but allowed others to take the
                            leadership roles I usually hold. I found this very freeing and allowed me to focus on my
                            research and enjoy my role in the performance more, and I will take this away from TEX411
                            week.”

                            “Overall, I ended up finding this week surprisingly fun and enjoyable. I say surprisingly as
                            the original brief seemed quite intimidating, including elements of acting etc. Also, I
                            originally didn’t think I would work in a group as well as I did, as I usually like to keep
                            everything quite personal and controlled. However, I think the collection of people in my
                            group and our dynamic together helped me to ease out of my comfort zone in that way. I
                            learned that I am quite capable at communicating with others, even when not in person, and
                            also learned that I am quite good at compiling people’s work into a group portfolio which
                            still showcases everyone’s efforts. I’m very happy that we got assigned the DofE audience,
                            as this was the audience I was most interested in out of the 3, and I’m very proud of our
                            group for the tour/performance we were able to create. I think the whole atmosphere of our
                            group work was quite playful, with everyone bouncing off of each-other, and this meant that
                            the experience of making as well as performing the tour was fun. The high-point for this
                            week, for me, was therefore the performance itself, as I just found myself completely
                            immersed, mostly in playing my character. I’m very excited to work with my group again on
                            future TEX weeks. In terms of things I’d like to improve about our group’s way of working, I
                            think keeping everyone updated even if they can’t make meetings is something that we could
                            do better, just to keep everyone engaged.”

                    “I enjoyed getting to work on a project as a group, Combining everyone's ideas and
                    researching/learning about rose bruford's history was interesting. I also enjoyed our final outcome
                    as it went really well, and the audience responded in the way we were trying to elicit. Seeing
                    people's reactions was important to me. Watching other people's tours was fun, especially the more
                    interactive ones. I found performing/public speaking anxiety-inducing but glad that I managed to do
                    it and push through. However I would rather not do anymore performing. As part of TEX411 I would
                    like there to be more opportunities for us to work within our own areas within the projects, so it
                    feels more relevant to our individual courses and we are making the most of combining the courses.
                    As it is there is not enough time for us to come up with our ideal costumes, and had to come up with
                    a very low effort alternative. This meant our focus was more on the performance aspect and this is
                    not something I really enjoyed and I would've maybe felt more accomplished if I'd gotten to
                    contribute something I was really passionate about. I found the UVA trip not to be accessible. While
                    I enjoyed a couple of displays, the majority of them contained too much flashing, meaning I had to
                    skip them. It was also extremely hard to skip them as we had to walk all the way round them to leave
                    the rooms. This meant my options were to either miss out of an experience that everyone else was
                    having or to be uncomfortable. Overall I learnt alot about different ways to communicate with a
                    range of different people and how to edit storytelling to suit different audiences.”

                            “I liked being able to work in a team, the good communication and assigned tasks made the
                            project easier and more organised as we all did our part of the work. I liked how my groups
                            final tour turned out, the tour played out smoothly and was fun to produce and watch as the
                            audience interacted well. I felt I did well on talking in the tour as I am typically quite
                            shy and struggle with communication, so I am proud that it went well, and I was able to
                            remember the majority of my script. The only problems we had in our tour was a few
                            last-minute changes to the individual scripts, we were all very receptive of these changes
                            and adapted quickly to them. I liked going into London, especially the UVA; the UVA was
                            really interesting and showed a wide variety of methods and artistic expressions. However, I
                            struggled in some sections that were disorienting like the edge of chaos as they made me
                            feel ill. On the other hand, the top-secret comedy club was slightly less interesting for
                            me, it was enjoyable, but it was late, and I was tired so wasn’t as receptive of the
                            stories. I feel I have learnt how to communicate in a team effectively, I haven’t often
                            worked in well-functioning teams that were able to split the work equally without relying on
                            one person.”

                            “There have been aspects of this week that I’ve enjoyed, such as the team work and the
                            camaraderie that working together has given. I enjoyed our group presentation, even thought
                            I don’t enjoy performing, and feel like our performance was well rounded and well received
                            by our audience. I feel that these skills could be better honed through a project that’s
                            more useful to our respective courses like in depth planning a play together, completing all
                            the processes that we will need to complete in our future, as the event that we did both
                            this TEX week and the last was irrelevant to our future. The comedy club was also a nice
                            addition to the week, if albeit irrelevant to the weeks theme.<br><br>The low point of our
                            TEX week for me was the UVA exhibit. I didn’t enjoy this exhibition as I didn’t find the
                            experience very emotive or relevant to our week theme. The art piece wasn’t very user
                            friendly, with poor signage and no accommodation for people with medical conditions or
                            disabilities.<br><br>I have connected more with my passion this week, as I’ve felt very
                            strongly both for and against certain aspects of this week.”

                    “Of the two TEX411 projects so far, I have found this one the most enjoyable and interesting. The
                    project overall was quite fun to put together and present, however I feel like I would’ve struggled
                    on either of the two other briefs. One of the main reasons I liked this brief is that I have
                    achieved the DofE awards, and I enjoyed the acting elements (especially getting to stand in the
                    lake).<br><br>Overall, I think the group did a good job following the given brief, except
                    potentially not linking the tour enough to Bruford. Incorporating a chronological narrative about
                    the college, as there wasn’t much inspiration taken from the legacy or history of it, could have
                    enhanced the content of the tour, as it was very much DofE focussed. However, I do feel that the
                    group collaborated effectively when planning, researching, and executing the tour, from sharing
                    different initial ideas to helping each other with the performances. This being a tour, we included
                    areas of the campus, such as the lake, to give more meaning to the discussed narrative. We also made
                    use of props and costumes throughout the tour, relating to the “Rose Bruford award”. The group
                    members all had different roles to play, such as Izzy’s teacher persona and  Emma & Dom being
                    troublemaking group members. We tried to use a soundscape in Dom’s rucksack, however it didn’t end
                    up working as you couldn’t really hear it. To make the audience feel more included in the tour, we
                    started with a “safety briefing” and gave them items used on DofE, such as maps and compasses, along
                    with making the audience navigate around the campus themselves.  We also had some members of the
                    group integrated into the audience, who roleplayed as people doing DofE, often creating
                    trouble.<br><br>I found the exhibition at 180 studios to be shallow and lacking any substantial or
                    meaningful throughline. Despite the interesting technical aspects of the pieces, there was no
                    engaging or thought-provoking content to be found - the artist decided to give the heavy lifting of
                    finding meaning in the pieces to the minds of the viewers. As for the comedy club, I liked the
                    underground and close-up nature of the venue (disregarding the horrific cable management), and I
                    found the comedians to be (for the most part) funny.<br><br>There are two possible interpretations
                    for the purpose of the places visited in London this week, the first of which being that the trip
                    was intended to influence the creative decisions for the making of the tours. To take this one into
                    consideration, I don’t believe that either event could be used to influence the tour, not only
                    because they don’t seem to have much connection to the subject matter, but they were only visited
                    the day before the final presentation, leaving limited time to implement ideas collected in London.
                    The alternative intention was to use them as a means to provoke critical reflection of the places
                    visited, to which I would say that better venue choices could’ve been made. One possible example
                    could’ve been Sunset Boulevard - the new showing of the classic musical in the West End could give a
                    good starting point for many discussions relating more closely to our disciplines, as it has a very
                    different and interesting take from the original showing.<br><br>Although we managed to incorporate
                    some of the technical disciplines, such as CP or SA, into the tour, there was nothing in the project
                    which allowed me to use or expand my field of knowledge, that being lighting. I believe that a
                    similar problem exists in the cabinet of curiosities, in which we spend a week collecting and
                    organising objects, instead of doing something more productive that relates to our courses. While I
                    understand that the skills we are covering are useful, I believe that they can be presented in such
                    a way that the technical aspects of the respective courses are integrated better into the projects.”
